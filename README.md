# INCEpTION

INCEpTION provides a semantic annotation platform offering intelligent annotation assistance and knowledge management.
For more information, visit the [INCEpTION website](https://inception-project.github.io/). For a first impression on
what INCEpTION is, you may want to watch
our [introduction videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ely8eBKqiSI&list=PL5Hz5pttaj96SlXHGRZf8KzlYvpVHIoL-).

INCEpTION is a text-annotation environment useful for various kinds of annotation tasks on written text. Annotations are
usually used for linguistic and/or machine learning concerns. INCEpTION is a web application in which several users can
work on the same annotation project, and it can contain several annotation projects at a time. It provides a *recommender system* 
that suggest potential annotations to help you create annotations faster and easier. Beyond annotating, you can also *create a corpus*
by searching an external document repository and adding documents. Moreover, you can use *knowledge bases*, e.g. for
tasks like entity linking.

## Getting started

The best way to get started is to
watch [our tutorial videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ely8eBKqiSI&list=PL5Hz5pttaj96SlXHGRZf8KzlYvpVHIoL-),
working through
the [Getting Started Guide](https://inception-project.github.io/documentation/latest/user-guide#sect_core_funct) and
playing with INCEpTION on the [demo server](https://morbo.ukp.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/demo).

## See our documentation for further reading

- **User Guide:** If you only use INCEpTION and do not develop it,
  the [User Guide](https://inception-project.github.io/documentation/latest/user-guide#sect_core_funct) beginning right
  after *Getting Started* is the guide of your choice. If it does not answer your questions, donâ€™t hesitate to contact
  us (see *Do you have questions or feedback?*).
- **Admin Guide:** For information on how to set up INCEpTION for a group of users on a server and more installation
  details, see the [Admin Guide](https://inception-project.github.io/documentation/latest/admin-guide).
- **Developer Guide:** INCEpTION is open source. So if you would like to develop for it,
  the [Developer Guide](https://inception-project.github.io/documentation/latest/developer-guide) might be interesting
  for you.

Many more materials like [example projects](https://inception-project.github.io/example-projects/)
, [use case descriptions](https://inception-project.github.io/use-cases/)
and [helpful scripts](https://inception-project.github.io/example-projects/python/) are available via the INCEpTION
homepage.

We also offer several Jupyter Notebooks which describe how you can interact in Python with INCEpTION, prepare or 
post-process annotations:

- [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/inception-project/inception/blob/master/notebooks/annotations_as_one_sentence_and_label_per_line.ipynb) Export annotations as one sentence per line
- [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/inception-project/inception/blob/master/notebooks/using_pretokenized_and_preannotated_text.ipynb) Use pre-tokenized and pre-annotated documents in INCEpTION
- ... [more Python examples](https://inception-project.github.io/example-projects/python/)


## Do you have questions or feedback?

INCEpTION is still in development, so you are welcome to give us feedback and tell us your wishes and requirements.

- For many questions, you find answers in the main documentation: [Core Functionalities](https://inception-project.github.io/documentation/latest/user-guide#sect_core_funct).
- Consider our Google group [inception-users](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/inception-users)
- You can also open an issue on [Github](https://github.com/inception-project/inception/issues).
