= Annotation Guidelines

Providing your annotation team with guidelines helps assuring that every team member knows exactly
what is expected of them.

*Annotators* can access the guidelines via the *Guidelines* button on the *annotation page*.

*Project managers* can provide these guidelines via the *Guidelines* tab in the 
*project settings*. Guidelines are provided as files (e.g. PDF files). To upload guidelines, 
click on *Choose files*, select a file from your local disc and then click *Import guidelines*. 
Remove a guideline document by selecting it and pressing the *Delete* button.
