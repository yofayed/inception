= Remote Lookup Feature

====
CAUTION: Experimental feature. To use this functionality, you need to enable it first by adding `annotation.feature-support.lookup.enabled=true` to the `settings.properties` file.
====

A remote lookup feature is basically a string feature, but it can query an external service for
possible values. The feature editor is a auto-complete field. When the user starts entering a 
value into that field, it is sent to a configurable remote URL as a query. The expectation is that
the response from the remote service is a JSON structure that contains possible completions.

A remote lookup service must support a **lookup** and a **query** functionality:
