= Annotation 

Here the project manager can configure settings that affect the experience on the annotation page.

== Default sidebar

Certain functionalities such as for example document-level annotations are accessible via a sidebar
on the annotation page. A project manager may choose a default sidebar here which will be expanded
by default when a new annotator opens a document for annotation. Note that this does not affect
any annotators that are already working in the current project. Thus, the manager should set the
default sidebar before adding annotators to the project. Not all pipelines are available to all
users. If the selected default sidebar is not available to a user, this setting has no effect. A
typical use for this setting is to set the document metadata sidebar as the default sidebar such
that annotators can open a document and immediately edit the document-level annotations without 
first having to search for the sidebar.
