= Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

== What tokenization does INCEpTION use?

INCEpTION uses the https://github.com/openjdk/jdk11/blob/master/src/java.base/share/classes/sun/text/resources/BreakIteratorRules.java[Java BreakIterator] internally.
Note that the linked file is part of a specific version of OpenJDK 11 and may change in other Java versions or for other Java vendors.

If you need to provide your own tokenization, then the best choice would be to use a format that supports it, e.g. XMI, WebAnno TSV or CoNLL formats.

== How can I annotate discontinuous spans?

The is no immediate support for discontinuous spans in INCEpTION.

However, you can emulate them using either a relations or link features.

You can define a relation layer on top of your span layer.
When you have multiple spans that should be considered as one, you can use a relation to connect them.

Or you can add a _Link: XXX_ feature to your span layer which either points to the same layer or which points to a new layer you might call e.g. _Extension_.

So when you have a discontinuous span, you could annotate the first span with your normal span layer and then add one or more links to the other spans.

== What is the relation between WebAnno and INCEpTION?

INCEpTION is the successor of WebAnno and evolved from the WebAnno code base. Both INCEpTION and WebAnno are currently developed/maintained by the same team at the UKP Lab at the Technical University of Darmstadt.

INCEpTION has all the flexibility and many more exciting features including a completely new human-in-the-loop annotation assistance support, the ability to search texts and annotations, support for RDF/SPARQL knowledge bases for entity linking, and much more.
And best: it can import your WebAnno annotation projects (Projects of type _automation_ or _correction_ are not supported).
