There are two options of theming {product-name}.

The recommended approach is placing a file named `theme.css` into the application home folder. If
this file is present, it is automatically loaded on all pages of the application. You can place 
custom styles into the file and make them override the default styles.

There is also the option to place a file called `bootstrap.css` into the application folder. If that
file is present, the built-in customized Bootstrap styles of {product-name} are not loaded and this
file is loaded instead. For the application to work, the custom `bootstrap.css` must be fully 
compatible with the built-in styles. To create such a file, obtain the `scss` files from the
link:https://github.com/inception-project/inception/tree/main/inception/inception-bootstrap/src/main/ts/bootstrap[inception-bootstrap] module for the {product-name} version that you are using, adjust
them, and use SCSS to compile them from the root `bootstrap.scss` file into a customized
`bootstrap.css` file. 

NOTE: New versions of {product-name} may come with changes to the CSS styles being used without
      any special announcement. If you use theming, be sure to thorougly review if your custom styles still
      work with new versions. Best keep any changes minimal.
