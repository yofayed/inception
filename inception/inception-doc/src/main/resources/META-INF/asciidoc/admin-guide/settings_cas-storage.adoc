= CAS storage

This section describes settings related to the storage of CAS data objects (i.e. annotations).

.CAS cache settings in the `settings.properties` file
[cols="4*", options="header"]
|===
| Setting
| Description
| Default
| Example

| cas-storage.compressed-cas-serialization
| Whether to compress annotation files
| true
| false
|===

The compression setting takes effect whenever a CAS is written to disk. Changing it does not 
immediately (de)compress existing CAS files. Instead, they will be slowly converted to being
(de)compressed over time as they are updated by the system as part of normal operations.

== CAS cache

To speed up interactions, {product-name} keeps a cache annotation data in memory. 
This cache can be tuned using the following properties:
