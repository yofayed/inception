= Logging

{product-name} comes with a default logging configuration that should serve well in a normal 
production environment, either on a server or running as a desktop application. However, for
more advanced scenarios, it may be useful to customize the logging configuration.

== Set specific log levels

Maybe you do not want to user a completely custom logging configuration and only wish to get a bit
more information in a particular part of the application. In this case, you can specify the log
level for particular packages or classes either by declaring logging properties either as system 
property (`-D`) argument when starting {product-name} or by adding them to the `settings.properties`
file. For example, if you wanted to get more information on the authentication process, you could
use the following properties:

[source,text]
----
logging.level.org.springframework.security=TRACE
logging.level.de.tudarmstadt.ukp.inception.security=TRACE
----

== Custom logging

A custom logging configuration can be specified when starting up {product-name} using the parameter
`-Dlog4j.configurationFile=/path/to/your/log4.xml`. This should be a standard Log4J configuration file.
A good starting point is the default configuration used by {product-name} which can be found in link:https://github.com/inception-project/inception/blob/main/inception/inception-app-webapp/src/main/resources/log4j2.xml[our code repository].

== Logging in JSON format

If you would like to integrate the logging output of {product-name} with something like LogStash and
Kibana, you may want log output to be in a properly interpretable JSON format, instead of the usual
plain text format. {product-name} comes with several JSON configurations that are compatible with
popular tools like LogStash and others. You can activate it by adding the following sections to a custom `log4j.xml` file in the `Appenders` sections and in the `Root` logger.

[source,text]
----
<Configuration ...>
  <!-- ... -->

  <Appenders>
    <!-- ... -->
    
    <RollingFile name="RollingFileAppender" fileName = "logs/inception.log"
                 filePattern="app-%d{MM-dd-yy-HH-mm-ss}-%i.log.gz">
        <JsonTemplateLayout eventTemplateUri="classpath:LogstashJsonEventLayoutV1.json"/>
      <Policies>
        <SizeBasedTriggeringPolicy size = "20 MB" />
      </Policies>
    </RollingFile>
    
    <!-- ... -->
  </Appenders>

  <Loggers>
    <!-- ... -->
    
    <Root level="warn">
      <!-- ... -->  
      
      <AppenderRef ref="RollingFileAppender" />
    </Root>
  </Loggers></Configuration>
