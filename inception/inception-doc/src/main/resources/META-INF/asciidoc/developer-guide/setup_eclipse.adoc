= Setting up for the development in Eclipse

This is a guide to setting up a development environment using Eclipse on Mac OS X. The 
procedure should be similar for other operation systems.  

First, you need to follow some steps of the <<admin-guide.adoc#sect_installation,Administrator Installation Guide>>. 
It is recommended to configure a MySQL-server.

We recommend you start from a *Eclipse IDE for Java Developers* package.

== Use a JDK

On Linux or OS X, the following setting is not necessary. Having a full JDK installed on your
system is generally sufficient. You can skip on to the next section.

On Windows, you need to edit the `eclipse.ini` file and directly before the `-vmargs` line, you
have to add the following two lines. Mind to replace `C:/Program Files/Java/jdk11` with the actual
location of the JDK/version on your system. Without this, Eclipse will complain that the 
`jdk.tools:jdk.tools` artifact would be missing.

.Force Eclipse to run on a JDK
[source,text]
----
-vm
C:/Program Files/Java/jdk11/jre/bin/server/jvm.dll
----

== Eclipse Plug-ins

* *Maven Integration:* m2e , already comes pre-installed with the Eclipse IDE for Java Developers.
  If you use another edition of Eclipse which does not have m2e pre-installed, go to *Help->Install
  New Software*, select "--All available sites--" and choose *Collaboration -> m2e - Maven Integration
  for Eclipse*

* *Apache UIMA tools:* go to *Help->Install New Software*, select "Add..." and add the update site: `http://www.apache.org/dist/uima/eclipse-update-site/` as a location. Install the *Apache UIMA Eclipse tooling and runtime support*.

* *Eclipse Web Development Tooling:* go to *Help->Install New Software*, select "--All available
  sites--" and select the following plug-ins for installation from the section *Web, XML, Java EE
  and OSGi Enterprise Development*:
** Eclipse Java Web Developer Tools
** Eclipse Web Developer Tools
** Eclipse XML Editors and Tools: already comes pre-installed in newer Eclipse versions

== Eclipse Workspace Settings

* You should check that Text file encoding is UTF-8  in *Preferences -> General -> Workspace* of 
  your Eclipse install.

== Importing {product-name} into the Workspace

Checkout out the {product-name} git repository with your favorite git client. If you use the command-line
client, use the command

[source,text]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/inception-project/inception.git
----

In Eclipse, go to *File -> Import*, choose *Existing Maven projects*, and select the folder to which
you have cloned {product-name}. Eclipse should automatically detect all modules.

== Setting up Checkstyle and Formatting

We use a style for formatting the source code in {product-name} (see <<Checkstyle and Formatting>>.
The following section describes how to use it with Eclipse.

First, obtain the DKPro code formatting profile from the link:https://dkpro.github.io/contributing/[DKPro website] (Section "Code style"). In Eclipse, go to **Preferences -> Java -> Code Style -> Formatter** to import the file. Apparently, the files can also be used with IntelliJ via the [Eclipse Code Formatter](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6546-eclipse-code-formatter) plugin.

NOTE: The parameter prefix `a` needs to be configured manually. In Eclipse go to 
       *Preferences -> Java -> Code Style* set the *prefix list* column in the *parameters* row to `a`.

Second, install the Checkstyle plugin for Eclipse as well as the Maven Checkstyle plugin for Eclipse.
These plugins make Eclipse automatically pick up the checkstyle configuration from the Maven project
and highlight formatting problems directly in the source code editor.

* Install *Checkstyle Eclipse plugin*: `https://checkstyle.org/eclipse-cs/#!/install` e.g. via the update site: `https://checkstyle.org/eclipse-cs/update`.
* Install the *Checkstyle configuration plugin for M2Eclipse*: via the update site `http://m2e-code-quality.github.com/m2e-code-quality/site/latest/`
* Select all {product-name} projects, right click and do a *Maven -> Update project*

NOTE: Should the steps mentioned above not have been sufficient, close all the {product-name} projects
      in Eclipse, then remove them form the workspace (not from the disk), delete any `.checkstyle` files
      in the {product-name} modules, and then re-import them into Eclipse again using *Import->Existing Maven
      projects*. During the project import, the Checkstyle configuration plugin for M2Eclipse should
      properly set up the `.checkstyle` files and activate checkstyle. +
      If the Maven project update cannot be completed due to missing .jars, execute a Maven install via right click on the inception project *Run as ->
      Maven build...*, enter the goal `install` and check *Skip Tests*. Alternatively, use the command `mvn clean install -DskipTests`.
