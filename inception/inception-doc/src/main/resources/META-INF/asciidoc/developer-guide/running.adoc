= Running {product-name}

To run {product-name} from your IDE, locate the class `de.tudarmstadt.ukp.inception.INCEpTION` and run it
as a Java application. This runs {product-name} as a Spring Boot application using an embedded
web server - similar to running the compiled JAR file from the command line. You may want to define
the following system properties in your launch configuration:

[cols="3*", options="header"]
|===
| Setting
| Value
| Description

| `inception.home`
| `/home/username/inception-dev` (adjust to your situation)
| Location to store the application data

| `wicket.core.settings.general.configuration-type`
| `development`
| Enable the development mode. This e.g. disables caches so that changes to HTML files in the IDE directly reflect in the running application.
