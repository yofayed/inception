= External Editors

This section introduces the mechanism for registering external editors in INCEpTION. An external
editor is an editor plugin implemented in JavaScript / TypeScript.

In order to use an external editor, create a folder `editors` in the INCEpTION home folder, then
within that folder create another folder for the editor plugin. The name of the folder will be the
identifier of the editor plugin (e.g. if you would later rename the folder, the editor ID saved
in the editor user preference would become invalid).

Within the editor folder, create a plugin descriptor file named `plugin.json`. This file contains all
important information required by INCEpTION to use the editor.

The way the plugin descriptor needs to be set up depends mainly on whether the editor plugin takes
care of rendering the full document or only the annotations. However, some settings are generic
for any type of editor plugin:

* `name`: the human-readable name for the editor
* `factory`: the JavaScript expression to access the annotation editor factory provided by the plugin

== Document-rendering editors

A document-rendering editor loads the document and annotation data from the backend and then renders
the document including the annotations. This is typically the case for editors using SVG to display
the document. The editor has the ability to define the layout of the document in such a ways that
the annotations fit nicely. 

For document-rendering editors, the `plugin.json` file offers the following settings:

* `view`: the HTML file used as a template for the editor plugin. The value must start with `plugin:`
  followed by a path to the HTML file within the plugin. E.g. if a template file `editor.html` is next
  to the `plugin.json` file in the same folder, use `plugin:editor.html`.

The external editor mechanism loads the template file within an IFrame that is embedded in the
annotation page. Any CSS or JavaScript files needed by the plugin must be referenced by the template
file using a relative location. For example let's assume a file `editor.html` which needs to load
a `editor.css` style sheet and an `editor.js` JavaScript file:

[source,html]
----
<meta charset="utf-8">
<title>DoccanoSequenceEditor demo</title>
<script src="./editor.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="./editor.css">
<div id="editor"/>
----

.Example `plugin.json` for document-rendering editors
[source,json]
----
{
  "name": "My editor",
  "factory": "MyEditor.default.factory()"
  "view": "plugin:editor.html"
}
----

== Editors using server-side document views

Some annotation editors overlay their annotations on an already existing document view. For example,
annotations could be overlaid on a HTML or PDF document. In this case, the external editor mechanism
can be configured to use a particular `DocumentView` plugin on the server to render the document and
to display it within an IFrame that is embedded in the annotation page. The editor plugin JavaScript
and CSS stylesheet files required are then injected into this IFrame as well. 

[source,json]
----
{
  "name": "My editor",
  "factory": "MyEditor.factory()",
  "view": "iframe:cas+html,
  "scripts": [ "editor.js" ],
  "stylesheets": [ "editor.css" ],
}
----

== Views

Currently supported views are:

* `iframe:cas+html` (deprecated): Renders HTML contained in the CAS into a HTML IFrame in the editor area.
* `iframe:cas+xml`: Renders XML contained in the CAS into a generic XML IFrame in the editor area.
* `iframe:cas+xhtml+xml`: Renders XML contained in the CAS into an XHTML+XML IFrame in the editor area.
HTML head and body elements are added automatically. The XML is rendered into the body.

== Policies

Every editor should provide a `policy.yaml` right next to the `plugin.json`. The `policy.yaml` declares
all elements and attributes that are supported by the editor. This policy file should be written as
a **safelist**, i.e. it should say exactly what is permitted instead of saying what is not allowed.
Allowing the wrong elements and attributes may cause security problems, e.g. if they can contain
executable JavaScript or load data from remote locations.

There are several elements like `script`, `meta`, `applet`, `link`, `iframe` as well as `a` which are
and JavaScript event attributes always filtered out.

If an editor does not provide a `policy.yaml` file, a default built-in policy is used which allows
most HTML formatting elements.

.Example `policy.yaml` file
[source,yaml]
----
name: Example policy
version: 1.0
case_sensitive: false
default_attribute_action: DROP
default_element_action: DROP
debug: false
policies:
  - { elements: ["html"], action: "PASS" }
  - { elements: ["p", "div"], action: "PASS" }
  - { elements: ["tr", "th"], action: "PASS" }
  - { attributes: ["class"], action: "PASS" }
  - { attributes: ["style"], action: "DROP" }
  - {
      attributes: ["title"],
      matching: "[a-zA-Z0-9]*",
      on_elements: ["div"],
      action: "PASS",
    }
----

There are two types of policies: **element policies**, and **attribute policies**.

=== Element policies
An element policy must contain the key `elements` which takes a list of element names and the key
`action` which can be either `PASS` or `DROP`. If an element is dropped, all child elements are
also dropped. Text within the child elements is replaced by an equivalent amount of space such that
offsets are not affected.

Note that the root element of your documents should always be allowed to `PASS`, otherwise the
document may fail to render.

It is possible to preserve elements within dropped elements by explicitly allowing the nested
elements to `PASS`.

[source,yaml]
----
policies:
  - { elements: ["root", "child2"], action: "PASS" }
  - { elements: ["child1"], action: "DROP" }
----

Using this policy, a document `<root><child1><child2>text</child2></child1/></root>` will be transformed
to `<root><child2>text</child2></root>`.

=== Attribute policies
An attribute policy must contain the key `attributes` which takes a list of attribute names, 
and the key `action` which can be either `PASS` or `DROP`. Optionally it may contain the the key 
`onElements` which takes a list of element names. If this key is present, the policy only affects
the attributes on the given elements, otherwise the policy affects all elements globally. Also, the
key `matching` can be optionally included to affect only attributes whose value matches the regular
expression provided as the value to `matching`.

When declaring attribute policies, the order matters. E.g. you should declare more specific policies
(e.g. such having a `onElements` or `matching` key) before less specific or global policies.

=== Debugging
To debug the rules, you can set the key `debug` to `true` and reload your editor in the browser.
Restarting the whole application is not required. When inspecting the content of the editor IFrame
in the browser's developer tools, you will see that elements and attributes matched by a `DROP`
policy have been prefixed with `MASKED-` instead of being fully dropped. Do not forget to set
debug back to `false` or to remove the key for actual use.

== Editor implementation

Editors can be implemented in JavaScript or languages that can be compiled to JavaScript such as
TypeScript. To facilitate the implementation, INCEpTION provides a set of interface definitions for
TypeScript, in particular `AnnotationEditorFactory` and `AnnotationEditor`.

To make use of these, set up a `package.json` file next to the `plugin.json` file. In the `package.json`
file, add `@inception-project/inception-js-api` as a dependency. The example below also already includes
TypeScript and ESBuild as dependencies.

[source,json]
----
{
  "name": "My Editor",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "scripts": {
    "build": "esbuild src/main.ts --target=es6 --bundle --sourcemap --global-name=MyEditor --outfile=editor.js"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@inception-project/inception-js-api": "*"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "esbuild": "^0.13.12",
    "typescript": "^4.4.2"
  }
}
----

NOTE: The `@inception-project/inception-js-api` module should eventually be available from the NPMJS. However, if you 
    have INCEpTION checked out locally, you may want to build your editor against the latest local version. To do this, 
    first build INCEpTION once e.g. using `mvn clean install` or within your IDE. Then go to the folder 
    `inception-application/inception/inception-js-api/src/main/ts` in your checkout and run `npm link`. After that, go to the
    folder containing your editor plugin and run `npm link "@inception-project/inception-js-api"` there. 
    
The minimal editor implementation consists of three JavaScript/TypeScript files:

* `main.ts`: the entry point into your editor module. It is referenced by the `build` script in the
  `package.json` file and provides access to your editor factory.
* `MyEditorFactory.ts`: a factory class implementing the `AnnotationEditorFactory` interface which facilitates
  access to your editor for the external editor mechanism. In particular, it provides means of
  instantiating and destroying an editor instance.
* `MyEditor.ts`: the actual editor class implementing the `AnnotationEditor` interface.
