This project has been pre-configured for sentence labeling tasks.

Best import documents in a format which gives you control over the sentence boundaries, such as e.g. 
**Plain text (one sentence per line)**, **Plain text (space-separated tokens, one sentence per line)**,
any of the CoNLL formats.

You can create an annotation on an entire sentence simply by double clicking anywhere in the sentence.

To adjust the available sentence labels, go to the **Tagset** panel in the project settings. Mind
that changing a tag's name does not update already created annotations, so best configure your
tagset before starting to annotate.

It also includes a recommender which learns from your annotations and suggests labels for yet 
untagged sentences.
