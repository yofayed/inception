= Documents

== Source documents

The original document uploaded by a user into a project. The document is preserved in its original
format.

== Annotation documents

Annotations made by a particular user on a document. The annotation document is persisted separately
from the original document. There is one annotation document per user per document. Within the tool,
a CAS data structure is used to represent the annotation document.
