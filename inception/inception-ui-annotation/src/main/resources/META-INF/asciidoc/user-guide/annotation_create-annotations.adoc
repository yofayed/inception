= Creating annotations

The *Layer* box in the right sidebar shows the presently active layer span layer. To create a span
annotation, select a span of text or double click on a word.

If a relation layer is defined on top of a span layer, clicking on a corresponding span annotation
and dragging the mouse creates a relation annotation.

Once an annotation has been created or if an annotation is selected, the *Annotation* box shows
the features of the annotation.

The definition of layers is covered in Section <<sect_projects_layers>>.
